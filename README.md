# CloudEvents Sample Example

## Introduction

CloudEvents is a standardized specification for describing event data across different cloud services. It aims to provide interoperability and consistency when dealing with event-driven systems, making it easier for developers to build and manage applications that rely on event processing.

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of CloudEvents using Python. It includes two components:
1. **Producer**: Responsible for generating and sending events.
2. **Consumer**: Responsible for receiving and processing these events.

## Project Structure

- `producer_events.py`: This script generates CloudEvents and sends them to a specified endpoint.
- `consumer_events.py`: This script listens for incoming CloudEvents and processes them accordingly.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- `cloudevents` library for Python
- `requests` library

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install cloudevents requests
